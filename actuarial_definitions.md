The portion of this actuarial present value allocated to a valuation year is called the normal cost. Each individual’s portion of the actuarial accrued liability should be determined on a consistent basis, usually as the retrospective accumulation of the individual’s prior actuarial accrued liability and prior normal cost, using the valuation actuarial assumptions. (ASOP No. [4][4])

##### Individual Policy:
> Any policy (or contract) that is defined as an individual policy under state insurance law or by the terms of the policy. Any certificate issued under any other policy that is sold to a passive trust but is marketed to individuals is also defined as an individual policy for purposes of this standard. (ASOP No. [33][33])

##### Individual Spread Gain Actuarial Cost Method or Individual Aggregate Actuarial Cost Method:
> A method under which the actuarial present value of each increment of an individual’s projected benefits is allocated on a level basis over the future earnings or service of the individual between the age at which such increment is first recognized and the exit age(s). The portion of this actuarial present value allocated to a valuation year is called the normal cost. The actuarial value of assets is deemed to be assigned to individuals on a reasonable and consistent basis; for example, each individual’s share may be the accumulation of his or her prior normal costs and any prior actuarial gains (losses) allocated to the individual. Actuarial gains (losses) are allocated to individuals in proportion to the assigned actuarial value of assets, or on any other reasonable and consistent basis. The actuarial accrued liability for an individual equals the assigned portion of the actuarial value of assets. (ASOP No. [4][4])

##### Judge:

##### Long-Term Care Insurance Plan:
> A policy, contract, or arrangement providing LTC benefits, either on a stand-alone basis or as part of a plan that provides other benefits as well (except where the LTC benefits are an immaterial feature).

(ASOP No. [18][18])

##### Long-Term (Custodial) Care:
> A wide array of health and other support services for people who suffer a loss of functional capacity that results in the need for continual one-to-one assistance of another person in the activities of daily living, such as walking, dressing, eating, toileting, or mobility. (ASOP No. [6][6])

An item or a combination of related items is material if its omission or misstatement could influence a decision of an intended user. When evaluating materiality, the actuary should consider the purposes of the actuary’s work and how the actuary anticipates it will be used by intended users. The actuary should evaluate materiality of the various aspects of the task using professional judgment and any applicable law (statutes, regulations, and other legally binding authority), standard, or guideline. In some circumstances, materiality will be determined by an external user, such as an auditor, based on information not known to the actuary.

(ASOP No. [2][2])

##### Nonguaranteed Element:
> Any element within an insurance policy that affects policy costs or values that is not guaranteed or not determined at issue. A nonguaranteed element may provide a more favorable value to the policyholder than that guaranteed at the time of issue of the policy. Examples of nonguaranteed elements include policy dividends, excess interest, mortality charges, expense charges, indeterminate premiums, and participation rates for equity-indexed life insurance products. (ASOP No. [24][24]) 

##### Nonguaranteed Element Framework:
> The structure by which the insurer determines nonguaranteed elements. This includes the assignment of policies to experience factor classes, the method of allocating income and costs, and the structure of the formulas or other methods of using experience factors. For participating policies this would be the dividend framework defined in ASOP No. 15. For life policies within the scope of ASOP No. 1, the nonguaranteed element framework would include the concepts of policy class, determination policy, and anticipated experience factors. (ASOP No. [24][24])

> For durations in the first segment (only), as determined under the contract segmentation method, the percentages that may be applied to the Model select mortality factors for the purpose of calculating deficiency reserves. Subject to the requirements set forth in section 5 of the Model, the X factors may vary by policy year, policy form, underwriting classification, issue age, or any other policy factor expected to affect mortality experience.
